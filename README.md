# Git 101: Git and GitHub for beginners

Tutorial on git and GitHub for beginners, designed for the [Women Who Code meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Boston/events/224072838/) held on August 12, 2015 at [HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com). 

Any important git-related words are **bolded**


### Step 1:  Cloning from a remote server to your local machine 

The process of downloading a **repo** from a remote server to your local machine is known as **cloning**.

To clone a repo, first you need to copy the repo's URL as seen below.

Move to where you want to place the project. For instance if you have a 'projects' folder on your desktop, you'd do something like 
```cd ~/Desktop/projects```

When you clone a repo, it downloads a brand new folder which contains all the files inside of it (so you don't need to make a specific folder for the project)

Once you're in the location you want to be, in the terminal, use the command:

```git clone https://github.com/cubeton/git101.git```

It should look something like:

It may prompt you to log in with your GitHub information.


### Step 2: Checking our your project

Now that you have the project on your local machine, you can look at all the files and the changes that have been made to it 

### Step 3: Creating a new branch

### Step 4: Adding a new file

### Step 5: Creating a new commit

### Step 6: Pushing a branch to the GitHub

### Step 7: Creating a Pull Request (PR)

### Step 8: Merging a PR

### Step 9: Cool features: the blame tool

Ever see a piece of completely incomprehensible code? Want to know who to complain to? **Git blame** is here to help!



Unfortunate side effect - I find that half the time when I use the blame tool to see who wrote a terrible piece of code, that it was me :(

### Step 9: Basking in your git glory

Great job!
